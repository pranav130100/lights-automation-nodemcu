# Lights Automation v1.0
### NodeMCU / Generic ESP8266 Module for Automating the Lights.
NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. It includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module. The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability produced by manufacturer Espressif Systems[1] in Shanghai, China.

# Features of ESP8266
- Processor: L106 32-bit RISC microprocessor core based on the Tensilica Xtensa Diamond Standard 106Micro running at 80 MHz
- Memory:
	- 32 KiB instruction RAM
	- 32 KiB instruction cache RAM
	- 80 KiB user-data RAM
	- 16 KiB ETS system-data RAM
- External QSPI flash: up to 16 MiB is supported (512 KiB to 4 MiB typically included)
- IEEE 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi
- Integrated TR switch, balun, LNA, power amplifier and matching network
- WEP or WPA/WPA2 authentication, or open networks
- 16 GPIO pins
- SPI
- I²C (software implementation)
- I²S interfaces with DMA (sharing pins with GPIO)
- UART on dedicated pins, plus a transmit-only UART can be enabled on GPIO2
- 10-bit ADC (successive approximation ADC)

# Summary of Project
- Easy to Program/Setup WiFi Access Point.
